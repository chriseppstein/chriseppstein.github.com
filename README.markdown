# Design Enthusiast - BrandonMathis.com

This project generates the HTML source for [Design Enthusiast](http://brandonmathis.com).

This website's live content is generated with [Henrik's version of Jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll/tree/master)
which adds support for HAML and SASS. This project Jekyll's HAML rendering, but it requires the
[Compass gem](http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass) to generate its stylesheets.

To generate the website in the output directory, type:

<pre>rake generate</pre>

To generate and deploy, type:

<pre>rake deploy</pre>
