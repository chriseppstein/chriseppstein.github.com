What if Sass is a "Developer's" Stylesheet Language?

If sass is a developer's stylesheet language what would happen?

Let us assume that compass and sass within the hands of a capable developer could reduce the implementation time to half that of the current state of the art. Let us also assume parity cost for a designer who can write css, and a developer who can write html templates and sass. Then in order to save costs a purchaser of such services would prefer designers who only "design" and then hand off pictures of websites to developers, even considering the added costs of information exchange.

Let me be the first to say that I think this would suck.

I want to encourage more designers to work directly with their medium. I think this makes designers better at what they do. The better the designers of our websites are, then the better our websites will be. To this end, I strive to make compass and sass accessible to designers. I strive to make html markup beatiful, and stylesheets simpler to write, read, and change.

And to this same end those "technical" designers have a vested interest in working with me. Because Sass isn't going to go away. And those designers who choose to embrace Sass become that better designer I imagined earlier and they will be better designers _and_ faster coders and they will champion the new approach and designers will have to learn a complicated developers tool instead of one designed for them.
