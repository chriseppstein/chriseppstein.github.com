            </h2>
            <div class="article"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>&#x000A;I donate my time to <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>.&#x000A;You <a href="https://secure.umdf.org/AutoGen/Simple/Donor.asp?ievent=420320&amp;en=clLNK3PLLbJWKdOOJaLSLfN5IpIVK6NPLgIRIeO6LzH">donate your money to the UMDF</a> and help&#x000A;find a cure for a disease that is killing kids and my dad.&#x000A;Everybody wins.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>As you probably know, I work at <a href="http://www.caring.com/">Caring.com</a>, a website devoted to&#x000A;caregivers of the sick and elderly. Caregiving is an issue that is near to my heart because&#x000A;my father was diagnosed with an extremely rare, terminal condition in 1992, when I was a&#x000A;sophomore in high school. His condition is so rare, only his family is known to have the&#x000A;exact form of it, but it is part of a class of diseases called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_disease">Mitochondrial Disorders</a>.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20101109-mm238g44f7xq6gu7ma6eintxw.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;">&#x000A;Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell and they are pretty cool little guys.&#x000A;Evolutionarily, mitochondria used to be their own organism, but a long time ago, they merged&#x000A;with one of our primordial ancestors and formed a symbiotic cellular relationship. They have&#x000A;their own DNA called mDNA and in my Dad, that DNA is broken. This breakage prevents him from&#x000A;converting ATP (cellular fuel) all the way into energy. This means that simple tasks that&#x000A;you and I take for granted like walking a quarter mile are near impossible. Organs, the brain,&#x000A;and the nervous system do not generally like running low on energy. Strange symptoms like&#x000A;uncontrollable movements, cramps, seizures, and vertigo can occur without warning. On top of&#x000A;all that, the disease has given him diabetes and he&#8217;s 100% insulin dependent.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20101109-cgswebet89ptpmjknrq2dc7q54.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" alt="My Dad">&#x000A;At the time of his diagnosis my father was given two years to survive. Our family mentally&#x000A;prepared itself for the inevitable, but my father refused to give up. He researched his&#x000A;own disease and started experimenting with his diet, medicines, and food supplements. Finding&#x000A;things that helped and iterating methodically and scientifically. After a few years, he&#x000A;found a combination of diet, medicine, and supplements that have slowed the progression&#x000A;to a crawl. My father is disabled, but his quality of life is pretty good for someone who&#x000A;is supposed to have been in the grave for 16 years now. We consider ourselves very fortunate&#x000A;to still have him in our lives. I am very proud of him &#8211; it is his pure dedication and&#x000A;relentless will to survive that keeps him with us. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t&#x000A;think I could eat virtually the same diet for a decade and still be sane.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p><em>(At this point, you might be wondering if I am risk to get this same disease. I appreciate&#x000A;your concern, but fortunately for me, this disease can only be passed from mother to child&#x000A;because sperm do not have mitochondria.)</em></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>But this is about as &#8220;happy&#8221; a story of mitochondrial disease as you&#8217;ll ever hear. For&#x000A;most, the onset of mitochondrial disease occurs at a very young age. These young children&#x000A;don&#8217;t understand why they can&#8217;t go outside and run around with their friends. Their parents&#x000A;have to hold them while they have seizures. And most die before they ever reach puberty.&#x000A;Mothers are left to outlive their children and to deal with the immense sense of loss and&#x000A;guilt of having passed on this condition to their children and wondering if and when they&#x000A;might themselves become symptomatic.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>About 1 in 4,000 children in the United States will develop mitochondrial disease by the&#x000A;age of 10 years. Up to 4,000 children per year in the US are born with a type of&#x000A;mitochondrial disease. <img src="http://img.skitch.com/20101109-gt9mf1r1bqt67crsedg57hre8r.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;">&#x000A;Like most rare diseases, pharmaceutical companies do not pursue cures&#x000A;because the small number of people with the disease makes it not worth their while. So the&#x000A;<a href="http://www.umdf.org/">United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation</a> (UMDF), a non-profit, was founded with the&#x000A;goal of providing support and research grants to scientists who are working on finding a cure&#x000A;or treatments.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>So I have decided to make Compass &#8220;Charityware&#8221;. <a href="http://charityware.info/">Charityware</a> is free software&#x000A;with a mission. If you use this software and it makes you more productive, increases your&#x000A;company&#8217;s bottom line, or nets your more take home per gig, then I ask that you would&#x000A;please make a <img src="http://www.umdf.org/atf/cf/%7B858acd34-ecc3-472a-8794-39b92e103561%7D/umdf_logo.gif" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;"><a href="https://secure.umdf.org/AutoGen/Simple/Donor.asp?ievent=420320&amp;en=clLNK3PLLbJWKdOOJaLSLfN5IpIVK6NPLgIRIeO6LzH">Tax Deductible donation on behalf of Compass to the UMDF</a>.&#x000A;It only takes a few minutes of your time and the money you donate <strong>will</strong> make a difference.&#x000A;If your business uses Compass, please see if they will donate or perhaps they might have a&#x000A;matching program during the holiday season for charitable giving.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Over the next few months, I will be working hard to get compass to version 1.0 and for&#x000A;over two years now I have been tirelessly to make stylesheets suck less. I have given&#x000A;many of you a level of personal support that most project maintainers do not provide. All&#x000A;free of charge. It would give me great pride if you all of you would do something that I&#x000A;cannot: Collectively give a sum of money to the <a href="http://www.umdf.org/">UMDF</a> that would far exceed my own&#x000A;ability to donate to them directly. I estimate that there are 10,000 to 20,000 users of&#x000A;compass. If each user gave $50, we could raise a $1 million. Will you <a href="https://secure.umdf.org/AutoGen/Simple/Donor.asp?ievent=420320&amp;en=clLNK3PLLbJWKdOOJaLSLfN5IpIVK6NPLgIRIeO6LzH">do your part</a>?</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Thanks!</p></div>
