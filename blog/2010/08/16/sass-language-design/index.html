              Sass Language Design: Philosophy & Approach
            </h2>
            <div class="byline">By Chris Eppstein & Natalie Weizenbaum</div>
            <div class="article"><p>Sass has a lot of language features that CSS does not provide. To&#x000A;the outside observer, the way new features come into existence&#x000A;might seem like a bit of mystery. It&#8217;s become clear recently&#x000A;that we need to do a better job of explaining it.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>First, there&#8217;s no formal process for how we decide to add new features to&#x000A;Sass. Good ideas can come from anyone from anywhere and we&#8217;re happy to&#x000A;consider them from the mailing list, IRC, twitter, blog posts, other css&#x000A;compilers, or any other source. However, most of the time we end up saying&#x000A;no.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>In this post, we hope to describe the thought process we go through to make&#x000A;those decisions. In future posts, Natalie and I will cover some&#x000A;often-requested features and why we&#8217;ve decided against them.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h2>Personas</h2>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>There are four personas who we consider when thinking about new Sass features:</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<dl>&#x000A;  <dg>&#x000A;    <dt>Beginning Front-Ender</dt>&#x000A;    <dd>Knows CSS syntax, but is confused and frustrated by the nuances of&#x000A;      building cross-browser websites. Often bases their stylesheets&#x000A;      using a core from a blog post or CSS framework. Maybe a programmer&#x000A;      who has to do CSS for one reason or another.</dd>&#x000A;  </dg>&#x000A;  <dg>&#x000A;    <dt>Knowledgeable Front-Ender</dt>&#x000A;    <dd>Has a strong working knowledge of CSS. Gets the job done,&#x000A;      but still gets frustrated when the styling for a site gets large and complex.&#x000A;      Reads blog posts about CSS, but probably doesn&#8217;t write them.</dd>&#x000A;  </dg>&#x000A;  <dg>&#x000A;    <dt>Expert Front-Ender</dt>&#x000A;    <dd>Lives and breathes CSS. Knows what to avoid and has most of&#x000A;      <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">quirksmode</a> memorized.&#x000A;      Has read several books on stylesheets. Can create novel designs&#x000A;      and implementations that inspire others.</dd>&#x000A;  </dg>&#x000A;  <dg>&#x000A;    <dt>Extension/Framework Builder</dt>&#x000A;    <dd>Sees patterns in their work and wants to share them&#x000A;      with others. Likely to have some programming skill.&#x000A;      May overlap with other personas to varying degrees.</dd>&#x000A;  </dg>&#x000A;</dl>&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>We&#8217;ve come up with these personas by talking to people who write CSS.&#x000A;We include as wide a sample as possible.&#x000A;We talk to people who love Sass, people who dislike it,&#x000A;people who are new to it and ask for help on the mailing list,&#x000A;and even people who have never heard of it.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>We&#8217;re primarily focused on supporting the knowledgeable front-ender,&#x000A;because that&#8217;s the largest group of users. For them, we want features&#x000A;that are frequently useful, and that don&#8217;t require exceptionally deep&#x000A;knowledge of CSS or Sass to use. Our secondary focus is&#x000A;making it easy for a beginner to get started using Sass, and to create&#x000A;cross-browser designs with very little effort.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Only once we&#8217;re confident that these two personas are well-served are&#x000A;we willing to add advanced features for the expert front-ender and the&#x000A;extension builder. This means that features that are very complex,&#x000A;that require advanced knowledge of CSS or Sass, or that require&#x000A;advanced programming ability, usually don&#8217;t make it in.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h2>The Gauntlet</h2>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Any new feature proposal must run the gauntlet, and be able to stand&#x000A;up against a series of difficult questions. Following is a list of&#x000A;some of these questions. It&#8217;s not comprehensive and we don&#8217;t&#x000A;explicitly check each one off, but it&#8217;s a good summary of our thought&#x000A;process when evaluating a new feature.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<ol>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>What problem does the feature solve?</strong> Any new feature must solve&#x000A;a real problem that can be clearly explained. The more common the&#x000A;problem, the more awesome the feature and Awesome is Sass&#8217;s middle&#x000A;name.</p></li>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>Does this problem have another solution?</strong> If an existing solution&#x000A;exists then we&#8217;d prefer to keep things as they are. But this does&#x000A;not mean that the feature is rejected, instead it must bring&#x000A;substantial benefit. This is often the case for those features&#x000A;that make a very common task easier. The ability to nest&#x000A;selectors is a good example of a feature that optimizes something&#x000A;that is very simple to do, but that happens a lot, resulting in a&#x000A;large cumulative benefit.</p></li>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>How does the feature interact with the other Sass features?</strong> Are&#x000A;there cases where the feature would introduce confusion? Features that&#x000A;work well with existing features are more likely to be accepted. Can&#x000A;the interaction of with another feature be reasoned about easily? Will&#x000A;it generate the expected result for a Sass user who understands both&#x000A;features individually? For instance, if a user understands both the&#x000A;parent selector (<code>&amp;</code>) and mixins, when she sees the <code>&amp;</code> used at the top&#x000A;level of a mixin, she&#8217;ll understand that it refers to the selector that&#x000A;includes the mixin.</p></li>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>Will the user understand the feature intuitively?</strong> Ideally, a new feature&#x000A;would be so obvious it wouldn&#8217;t need any explanation at all.&#x000A;Unfortunately, this can&#8217;t always be the case. If it does need to be&#x000A;learned, how hard is it? Can it be explained to even the beginning&#x000A;front-ender in one or two sentences? Variables pass this test with&#x000A;flying colors &#8211; when a new user sees them, they know what&#8217;s going on&#x000A;right away. Mixins usually aren&#8217;t that obvious, but they require very&#x000A;little explanation to be clear.</p></li>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>Does the feature make a stylesheet harder to maintain?</strong>  When a&#x000A;feature would create a situation where a change in one place in the&#x000A;stylesheet causes unexpected changes elsewhere, it&#8217;s unlikely to be&#x000A;accepted. Many features found in other CSS preprocessors fail this&#x000A;test, and it is our primary reason for rejecting them in Sass. Usually&#x000A;we consider this question in the context of a team of designers working&#x000A;on one stylesheet, or one person picking up a stylesheet that hasn&#8217;t&#x000A;been touched in months and changing it without fear.</p></li>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>Does the feature make something new possible?</strong>&#x000A;This question is structural in nature: of course, Sass can&#8217;t add&#x000A;anything that&#8217;s impossible in CSS. But the <code>@extend</code> directive and&#x000A;numeric expressions are great examples where features allow the&#x000A;expression of a relationship that exists in practice but that couldn&#8217;t&#x000A;be expressed in a stylesheet before.</p></li>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>Will the feature be misused?</strong> Sass&#8217;s philosophy leans towards&#x000A;giving power to advanced users, but there are cases&#x000A;where a powerful feature is likely to be misused by a beginning user.&#x000A;Unless it provides enough benefit to warrant inclusion anyway,&#x000A;it&#8217;s likely to be rejected.</p></li>&#x000A;<li><p><strong>Is it CSS-y?</strong> Sass syntax should feel right at home with CSS syntax&#x000A;and its existing semantics and structure. This means that sometimes a&#x000A;good idea gets changed a lot between initial concept and final&#x000A;implementation. For instance, <a href="/blog/2009/10/12/css-class-inheritance/">there were several syntaxes we considered for&#x000A;providing the ability to inherit selectors</a>.</p></li>&#x000A;</ol>&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;<h2>For Example</h2>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>A common request that we get for sass is to allow <code>@import</code> to import an entire&#x000A;folder of sass files with one call using some sort of globbing syntax. This&#x000A;feature has been rejected and you can view the <a href="http://github.com/nex3/haml/issues/issue/97">feature request for&#x000A;it</a> if you like.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<ol>&#x000A;<li><strong>Does it solve a problem?</strong> Yes, this feature solves a common problem of&#x000A;having to create a top level import file and then specify each imported file&#x000A;explicitly. This saves time because the person adding a new stylesheet doesn&#8217;t&#x000A;have to worry about adding it to their master stylesheet.</li>&#x000A;<li><strong>Does it have an existing solution?</strong> Sort-of. The import directive can accept&#x000A;more than one stylesheet separated by commas.</li>&#x000A;<li><strong>Does it interact well with existing features?</strong> It has no positive or&#x000A;negative impact.</li>&#x000A;<li><strong>Will the user understand it intuitively?</strong> Yes. We think it is not hard to&#x000A;understand this feature and most users will grok it immediately or can learn&#x000A;it in a few minutes of research.</li>&#x000A;<li><strong>Does the feature make a stylesheet harder to maintain?</strong> This feature would&#x000A;make stylesheets easier to maintain in some respects: Less files changed when&#x000A;adding a new one, less time spent figuring out that you forgot to import it.&#x000A;But it will also make some stylesheets harder to maintain: Adding a new file&#x000A;might import into a point of the cascade that causes styles to apply in an&#x000A;unexpected way &#8211; fixing this requires reverting to the current import&#x000A;mechanism and debugging it might take a while to understand.</li>&#x000A;<li><strong>Does the feature make something possible that wasn&#8217;t possible before?</strong> Yes.</li>&#x000A;<li><strong>Will the feature be misused?</strong> Yes. This feature is best used when following&#x000A;certain best practices like having scoped stylesheets or importing library&#x000A;files that don&#8217;t themselves define any selectors, but there&#8217;s no good way to&#x000A;enforce this, thus leaving the the feature open to misuse by users who think&#x000A;they are saving time only to lose all those savings and then some when it&#x000A;fails for them.</li>&#x000A;<li><strong>Is it CSS-y?</strong> Yes. Presumably the syntax for such a feature would use <code>*</code> to&#x000A;glob imports and <code>*</code> means any element in a selector so it has some&#x000A;familiarity.</li>&#x000A;</ol>&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Clearly this feature was a mixed bag. It benefits some users but it also&#x000A;discourages other users from thinking through an important aspect of CSS:&#x000A;Where does a partial belong in the cascade. If the feature offered a greater&#x000A;benefit to the power users, it might have been approved but files are added&#x000A;rarely and the error scenarios around forgetting to add an import are much&#x000A;easier to diagnose than the error scenarios around breaking the cascade. At&#x000A;the end of the day, we said no to this feature because it had more downsides&#x000A;than upsides in a &#8220;weighted average&#8221; sense.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h2>We&#8217;re not perfect</h2>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>We understand that reasonable people might come to different conclusions&#x000A;when they evaluate features against these criteria. Many of them can be&#x000A;influenced by one&#8217;s past experiences and their mindset. In this respect,&#x000A;it&#8217;s good that there are other stylesheet compilers making different decisions&#x000A;about what features should exist and what features shouldn&#8217;t. It allows for&#x000A;experimentation and learning.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>At the end of the day, someone has to make a decision about whether a proposed&#x000A;feature is in or out. In almost all cases, Natalie and I come to an agreement&#x000A;&#8211; sometimes this takes minutes, sometimes it takes weeks or more. But open&#x000A;source software is generally governed by a <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s16.html">benevolent dictatorship</a>&#x000A;and for at least a couple years now that person has been Natalie. I&#8217;ve found&#x000A;her to be increasingly good at this role. She&#8217;s eager to hear new ideas,&#x000A;and careful in her consideration. With a well crafted argument, it is very&#x000A;possible to change her (and my) mind.</p></div>
