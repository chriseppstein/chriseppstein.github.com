              Balancing Complexity in Sass
            </h2>
            <div class="article"><p>Psst. I want to let you in on a little secret about Sass. Let&#8217;s keep&#x000A;this between you and me: <em>Sass doesn&#8217;t have any original ideas in it</em>. I&#x000A;think this is actually the key to Sass&#8217;s success. Original ideas are&#x000A;hard to understand. Every single Sass feature is simply a formalization&#x000A;of what developers had already been doing.  Initially, Sass features&#x000A;simplified what developers were doing in CSS, or in templating languages&#x000A;on top of CSS, and simply put a nice abstraction on top of existing&#x000A;patterns that we saw in use every day.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>As Sass has progressed, we have turned that eye of simplification onto&#x000A;Sass itself. Recently, some Sass features have been added to simplify&#x000A;the Sass code we saw people writing every day and the language&#8217;s&#x000A;expressiveness has continued to increase.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>As Sass has become more powerful, we are starting to reach a very&#x000A;interesting point in the language&#8217;s maturity: Sass users are now able to&#x000A;express in Sass syntax complex behavior for things that they would have&#x000A;used to only imagine as language features.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>As you might expect, when implementing a complex behavioral pattern in&#x000A;Sass, the code is going to be complicated. Recently, I read a blog post&#x000A;calling out someone blogging about a Sass pattern they&#8217;ve found useful&#x000A;and saying that they had gone &#8220;too far&#8221; and created code that is&#x000A;&#8220;unmaintainable&#8221;.  But if it&#8217;s done right, that complexity is hidden&#x000A;behind a strong abstraction.  So the question is, how far is too far?&#x000A;When has a Sass developer jumped the shark and made something that is&#x000A;unintelligible and unmaintainable?</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>I&#8217;ll grant you, sometimes I read a Sass user&#8217;s code and I shake my head&#x000A;and say to myself:</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/glxrZ.jpg" alt="You took too much man" /></p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>I see a pattern as new Sass features are introduced or when people first&#x000A;discover the language (this is true for other technologies as well). We&#x000A;want to try them out! And in doing so, we tend to reach a bit too far.&#x000A;Maybe we nest too deep. Maybe we make too many mixins or extend things&#x000A;that should not have been extended&#8230; because we can. And then we&#x000A;experience this and realize it&#8217;s not better and then we find the happy&#x000A;medium of when and where to use a particular feature.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>I will grant you that concepts implemented in pure Sass might not feel&#x000A;as natural as if they were in Sass itself. In fact, the limitations of&#x000A;the Sass syntax might make an otherwise good idea, bad in practice. But&#x000A;I <strong>always</strong> appreciate the attempt to find a simplification that works.&#x000A;Every community needs these risk-taking, crazy people who are willing to&#x000A;buck trends and try things that may actually be terrible ideas. Because&#x000A;the only way to have a great idea is to have lots of ideas and for us to&#x000A;share them, try them and critique them. Bad ideas will wither and die.&#x000A;But the good ideas will spread because they will make people&#8217;s code&#x000A;better.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>I would encourage people who have tried to do something in your Sass&#x000A;project only to discover that it turned out to be a net negative, <em>you&#x000A;need to undo that mistake</em>. Don&#8217;t leave bad ideas in your project &#8211; but&#x000A;also don&#8217;t be afraid to try them! And if you write something&#x000A;complicated, by all means <a href="http://mts.io/2014/04/02/sass-unit-testing/">test&#x000A;it</a> and document it.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>I for one am really happy to see Sass reach this point where the&#x000A;language can self-host new ideas. As one of the language&#8217;s designers,&#x000A;seeing things actually working for people makes a very strong case for&#x000A;what should become part of Sass&#8217;s core feature set. Or maybe they point&#x000A;towards features that make it easier to extend Sass&#8217;s syntax in a more&#x000A;natural way. I&#8217;m not entirely sure yet.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Finally, when you look at a some concept that causes you to scratch your&#x000A;head, you can actually read the implemenation. And when you do, If your&#x000A;reaction is &#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s too much!&#8221; instead of &#8220;Cool, I can figure this&#x000A;out!&#8221;  Then, I humbly submit that you are being short-sighted. The&#x000A;underlying implementation of <em>everything</em> you do every day when working&#x000A;on the web is so incredibly complex. The fact that a little bit of that&#x000A;complexity is accessible to you instead being neatly tucked away across&#x000A;a language barrier, doesn&#8217;t make things inherently less maintainable.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>In fact, it may make them more maintainable. Strong abstractions are&#x000A;stable and don&#8217;t need updates very often, so even if the code is&#x000A;complex, that&#8217;s ok. As long as it presents a coherent, well-tested API,&#x000A;you will have a codebase that is usually more maintainable one the&#x000A;whole. And in the rare case where you find a bug in Sass code, instead&#x000A;of in something in Sass itself, you&#8217;ll be able to actually dig in and&#x000A;maybe even fix it yourself instead of just filing a bug and hoping for a&#x000A;fix.</p></div>
