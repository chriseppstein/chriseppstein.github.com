    %small.soft.block Lead UI Engineer
    %p Terraspring was about 10 years ahead of its time. We invented utility computing (as in we coined the phrase), but didn't get anyone rich. Especially me. But I learned to be an engineer while working there with some of the most amazing engineers I've ever met. I implemented a Visio-like graphical network editor with a drag and drop UI for creating and managing virtual networks -- in IE5. I got very good at javascript there.
