Have you ever built some sass that made you proud and wanted to share it with the world? Sure you could paste it online, but it will quickly disappear into the ether. 

The [Sass Recipes](http://chriseppstein.github.com/sass-recipes/) repository is a community maintained collection of working Sass examples for you to use to show off just how Sassy you can be.

Anyone can have commit access to this [repo](http://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-recipes), just ask for commit access or I will grant it automatically if you send me a pull request with a patch.

Happy Styling!
