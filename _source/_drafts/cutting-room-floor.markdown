If your job is to build and maintain a website that looks good in every common browser, then hands down, you have one of the hardest jobs on the internet. I've done just about every aspect of the job, from database to front-end, and every layer in between. Front-end engineering is hard. It's so hard because it brings together three things for which you have no control: Browsers, Users and Opinions. Browsers are different; Users are going to find every one of your flaws; and since everyone has an opinion on the interface, you're going to be changing it -- probably just after you get it working.
