title: High Quality Ampersands on the Web
---

Want a fancy Ampersand on the web? You're best bet is to use an italic serif font, but what fonts are safe? Until we have @font-face, [here are your options](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/08/14/ampersands.html)

Baskerville is my favorite on this page. For a font that likely on windows I'd choose Palatino Linotype as a backup.
