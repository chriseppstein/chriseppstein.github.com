![Adobe ruins usability with a hideous scrollbar](/content/blog/2008/adobe_scrolls.png "hideous")

This is offensive! DO NOT take over my web browser user interface.

Note: not only did they change the look of my sidebar, they also broke scrolling with my mouse. This is unacceptable, especially from a company that creates design tools.
