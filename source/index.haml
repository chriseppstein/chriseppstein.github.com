    The Terralien site redesign project was a collaborative effort by designers
    in the crew. In my mockup I focused mainly on expanding the space theme
    through illustration and logo adaptation. I took inspiration from old toy
    packaging and various 1950â€™s space posters to bring elements of fun into the
    design.
